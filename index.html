  <h1> <span style="color:#640c98">Tell NYU:</span> Amnesty for <b>all</b> suspended or disciplined students—<span style="text-decoration: underline">now</span>! </h1>
  <p> On Feb. 19, 2025, NYU suspended three more student-workers, all from the Department of Art and Public Policy, for participating in a study-in at Bobst Library on December 11, 2024. This includes an <b>international student, who will be deported immediately</b>, and resulted in the loss of the students' on-campus jobs, their <b>primary means of supporting themselves.</b> </p>
  <p> We call on the University to <b>immediately reverse the suspensions</b> of these three student-workers, who have been subjected to draconian punishment for upholding the very values of principled nonviolent activism the University claims to champion. </p>

    <a href="mailto:lgm2@nyu.edu;rar9900@nyu.edu;caj2@nyu.edu?subject=Unsuspend NYU students!&body=Dear NYU Administration,
On [TKTKTK], three more student-workers and GSOC members were suspended for participating in non-violent anti-war protests, resulting in the loss of their [TKTKTK] financial stability and posing a threat to their immigration status. This was in response to their participation in a study-in at Bobst Library on December 11, 2024.
I am writing to demand that NYU immediately reverse the suspensions of these three student-workers, as well as the [TKTKTK] others who have been subjected to punitive measures for engaging in principled, thoughtful, and nonviolent activism—values that the university claims to uphold. 
It is clear that these students are facing excessively harsh punishment for their exercise of free expression. The University’s response to these students’ activism is not only disproportionate, but it is politically motivated, influenced by a broader, harmful agenda aimed at suppressing freedom of expression rather than upholding academic and institutional integrity. 
In solidarity with the affected students and with those continuing to support the fundamental right to freedom of speech, expression, and assembly, we demand that NYU reconsider these unjust decisions and reinstate the suspended students and student-workers without delay.
Sincerely,
[Name] " class="btn">#1 - E-mail NYU</a>
