  <h1> <span style="color:#640c98">Tell NYU:</span> Amnesty for <b>all</b> suspended students—<span style="text-decoration: underline">now</span>! </h1>
  <p> On Feb. 19, 2025, NYU suspended three more student-workers, all from the Department of Art and Public Policy, for participating in a study-in at Bobst Library on December 11, 2024. This resulted in the loss of the students' on-campus jobs, their <b>primary means of supporting themselves.</b> </p>
  <p> We call on the University to <b>immediately reverse the suspensions</b> of these three student-workers, who have been subjected to draconian punishment for upholding the very values of principled nonviolent activism the University claims to champion. </p>

Dear NYU Administration,%0A%0A

On February 19th, three more GSOC student-workers were suspended for participating in a study-in at Bobst library, resulting in the loss of their on-campus jobs and only means of supporting themselves.%0A%0A

I am writing to demand that NYU immediately reverse the suspensions of these three student-workers, as well as all others who have been subjected to punitive measures for engaging in “free speech and inquiry... debate, challenge, and protest”--principles that NYU claims to uphold.%0A%0A

It is clear that these students are facing excessively harsh punishment for their exercise of free expression. The University’s response to these students’ activism is not only disproportionate, but it is politically motivated, influenced by the Palestine exception and a broader, harmful agenda aimed at suppressing freedom of expression rather than upholding academic and institutional integrity.%0A%0A

In solidarity with the affected students and with those continuing to support the fundamental right to freedom of speech, expression, and assembly, we demand that NYU reconsider these unjust decisions and reinstate the suspended students and student-workers without delay.%0A%0A

Sincerely,%0A
